        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Shreesha Thapa, I was born in Nepal and moved to the USA in 2011 with my family. 
            I am 19 years old. I am majoring in Associates in Web developer degree at Wake Technical Community College.
            This is my first semester taking Web development classes, I was uncertain of the path I had chosen, 
            but I am extremely delighted to have found my passion this early in my academic career. 
            My interest peaked in developing as a result of me helping my dad choose a website template and design intention for our familyâ€™s restaurant website. 
            Subsequently, I began researching about the degree and saw a great deal of potential in a way that was beneficial for me. 
            My fascination with the degree was that it displayed tremendous scope for the future. 
            From the research I carried out, I can conclude that an interactive website is absolutely necessary for any kind of business that desires an online presence. 
            Consequently, web developers will be in increasingly high demand.
            As of right now, I am in the process of completing one C# and two html/CSS courses. 
            All the projects within said courses have helped me attain a fundamental understanding of the programming languages. 
            As a novice developer, I hope to receive guidance and develop a network of my peers and mentors as I am working towards advancing my career.</p>
